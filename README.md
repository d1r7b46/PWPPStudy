# PWPP Study Plan

## Introduction
Hello! In early 2025, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-szczepkowski">Shawn</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angsec">myself</a> created a plan and ran a study group as we prepared for TCM Security's Practical Web Pentest Professional (PWPP). We hope that this will help folks in the future to land this cert! If this page is incomplete, we are currently running the study group on the <a href="https://discord.gg/GYBUtkUCyF">f0xhunt Discord server</a>. 

There are a couple affiliate links here. If you by chance benefitted from the education plan we've put together please consider using them or paying it forward with mentorship to others as they come up. <3 <br><br><br>

## Educational Topics and Plan
The following topics are taught within the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-web-hacking"> Practical Web Hacking</a> and <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/hacking-apis">Practical API Hacking</a> courses, and will have sections below: <br>
- **How web applications work** <br>
- **Authentication attacks** <br>
- **Broken access control** <br>
- **Server-side request forgery** <br>
- **Advanced SQL injection attacks and NoSQL injection** <br>
- **File inclusion** <br>
- **XML External Entity Injection** <br>
- **XSS and filter bypasses** <br>
- **Attacking JSON Web Tokens** <br>
- **Mass assignment** <br>
- **Open redirects** <br>
- **Race conditions** <br>
- **Enumerating APIs** <br>
- **Chaining vulnerabilities** <br><br>

We do suggest you do everything in each section! Sections will direct the learner to do both the segment within the TCM course and also provide additional videos, reading, and labs to fully learn the topic. 
As a last note, we have tried to keep the plan low to no cost but it is possible that the labs included will not all be free.
